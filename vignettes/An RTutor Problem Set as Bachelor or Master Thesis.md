# Part 1: Overview of the main steps

This guide helps you writing an RTutor problem set based on an economic
article as part of your Bachelor or Master thesis. Such a thesis 
requires substantial time and work: you need to dig deep into the topic
of the article, into econometric methods and into R programming.
So this is not the easiest way for writing a thesis, but from most students who have already mastered this challenge, I got a lot of positive feedback: You learn a lot, and it can be quite fun and rewarding to create and share a nice RTutor problem set.


## Step 1: Find an interesting economic article

First you need to find an interesting article for which the data (and ideally also the original code) is accessible. You can check out the following web app for this purpose:

[http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de:3200/ejd/](http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de:3200/ejd/)

You should try to pick an article for which no RTutor problem set has already been generated according to the list on the RTutor Github site: [https://github.com/skranz/RTutor/](https://github.com/skranz/RTutor/)

An alternative list of selected (older) articles with data from several journals can be found here:

[http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/rtutor/articles.html](http://econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/rtutor/articles.html)

(I have very roughly sorted the list according to which articles I personally find more interesting.)

The list and app is updated only sporadically. You can also search for newer articles on the journal websites of the American Economic Association:

[https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/)

These websites store the datasets from the Review of Economics and Statistics and the Quarterly Journal of Economics

[https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/restat](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/restat)

[https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/qje](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/qje)

(To find the corresponding articles, you have to google their names)

### Data and code
From the articles website you can typically also download a zip file that contains the articles' data sets and codes. If you download and open the zip file, you typically find a README file (possibly in pdf or txt format). It describes the contributed data sets and codes. In particular, it is noted whether all data for replication is available or whether some data must be bought or is inaccessible. You should choose an article where all data is available, or at least most parts of the article can be replicated with the available data.

### Contributed code
Most articles have contributed Stata code in `.do` files, which can be opened with any text editor. Sometimes there is also code in other languages like Matlab `.m` or C, Fortran, Python, R, ... As a rough rule of thumb, articles that only contain Stata code are easier to replicate than articles that also contain Matlab or other code. If you search for articles with JEL code, you see for many articles already an overview of the types and size of code files, e.g.
```
  Inventories, Lumpy Trade, and Large Devaluations (55.41 MB, aer, 2010/12)
  ...
  Code in KB: do: 53 m: 449; Data (decompressed): 206.6 MB
```
This article has 54 KB of Stata code (in .do files) and 449 KB of Matlab code in (.m) files and around 206.6 MB of data files.


### Selecting an article

Best find some candidate articles and then talk with me before selecting one.
Some constraints have to be satisfied, e.g. you should not take some article
for which already a RTutor problem set has been created.

## Step 2: Take a look at an existing interactive problem set

(Note: You can swap steps 2 or 3) 
On the Github page of RTutor [https://github.com/skranz/RTutor](https://github.com/skranz/RTutor) you find links to several RTutor problem sets that have been created as part of a Bachelor- or Master thesis. Try installing one or more problem sets from their Github page and try them out. This helps you to get an idea, how problems could be structured, which elements you like, and which you like less. Also you can learn a bit more R. For starts, I would recommend:

[https://github.com/brigittepeter/RTutorWaterPollutionChina](https://github.com/brigittepeter/RTutorWaterPollutionChina)

You can also download the whole Github package as ZIP file and take a look at the source code of the problem set. If the problem set is called `myps`, the source code of the problem set is in the file `myps_sol.rmd` in the folder `/inst/ps/myps/`.

## Step 3: Work through the article and replicate the code in R

Now work through your article and the code. Then try to replicate most results in R. At this point you don't yet have to think about the design of the problem set, just try to make the analysis run in R. You should use helpful R packages like `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `reshape2`, `tidyr` or `lfe` to write more elegant and shorter R code. Take a look at the section of recommended packages below! You can learn more about useful functions in these packages, e.g. by solving an existing problem set in Step 2.

If you cannot replicate all results in R, or you find bugs in the Stata code, write down all these points. This will be a useful appendix to your thesis.

Even though your final "product" will be written in R, it can be helpful to run the given code in Stata, in order to better understand it. I can send you a guide for several ways how to use Stata at Ulm University.

## Step 4: Create your thesis in form of an interactive RTutor problem set 

Now you can start creating the RTutor problem set. For information of how problem sets are build, look at the main RTutor page here:

[https://skranz.github.io/RTutor/](https://skranz.github.io/RTutor/)

In particular look at the different articles listed under `Manuals`.

As an initial template for your problem, either use the example file in the RTutor package:

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skranz/RTutor/master/inst/examples/Example_sol.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skranz/RTutor/master/inst/examples/Example_sol.Rmd)

or even better a solution file from one of the existing problem sets. First try to make the example run before you build your own exercises. Note that some bugs and features are not yet well documented. So just drop by, if it does not run.

Parts 2-4 below give detailed advice on how the problem set should be structured, and which R packages seem useful.

## Step 5: Ask your advisor soon for feedback and improve the problem set

Try to have ready a first version working version of your interactive problem set quite soon and ask your advisor for feedback. This version must not yet contain all exercises, but one should be able to try it out. 

**You should have at least half of the time for your thesis left, when you send a first version of your problem set to your advisor.**

You need the second half of time to improve the problem set.

From my experience, the first working drafts of a problem set, may already have many good ideas, but are still very far away from a nicely polished final product. Most problem sets have been substantially restructured and improved compared to the first version. Typically there will be quite some iterations, where you send a new version of the problem set to your advisor, discuss it together and then improve the problem set. This gradual improvement process takes substantial time, however.

The main reason why a thesis falls below the desired quality is that you send a draft to late to your supervisor and don't have enough time for the multiple rounds of feedback and improvement.

## Step 6: Create a printable PDF or Word file of your thesis

Your problem set will be the core and main part of your thesis. All essential parts a thesis, like discussion of related literature, references, or own discussion, should also be part of your problem set. Still you may add a page at the beginning or end of your written thesis, e.g. briefly discuss how you have designed your problem set and which problems you have encountered.

Many existing problem sets also contain their thesis in the Github repositories, which can give you some idea, how you can create the thesis from your problem set. 

To create a printable version of your thesis, you can use Word or Latex or directly from a Markdown format. When you create your interactive problem set with the command `create.ps(...)` a file with the ending `..._output_solution.Rmd` is created in your working directory. It contains a RMarkdown version of your solved problem set, which you can translate from RStudio to Latex or Word in order to easier include your problem set in your thesis.

For details how you can translate an Rmd file into different formats in RStudio, see the links here:

[http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html)

You can also first convert your `..._output_solution.Rmd` file to a markdown `.md` file and then use the program pandoc [http://pandoc.org/](http://pandoc.org/) to convert it to another file format. This allows you to use more flexible command line options.

You typically need to manually adapt the resulting files. For example, HTML tables or dynamic web graphics will typically not be automatically converted. So you may have to add them via copy and paste or copy the graph via a snipping tool. It may also be helpful to change the output format of stargazer commands from HTML to text or latex in your `..._output_solution.Rmd` file.

## Step 7: Host your problem set on Github and shinyapps.io

If you have finished a first or later version of your problem set, you can already put it on the web (you can always update the web versions). I would recommend to host it as an R package on Github. How to do it, is explained in detail here:

[Deploy RTutor problem sets on Github](https://skranz.github.io/RTutor/articles/05_Deploy%20Problem%20Sets%20as%20Package%20on%20Github.html)

Furthermore, I would recommend to also host your problem set on shinyapps.io. This allows users to directly solve your problem set in the web without having to install R. (The free service is restricted to 30 access hours per month, however). This is described here:

[Deploy RTutor problem sets on shinyapps.io](https://skranz.github.io/RTutor/articles/06_Deploy%20problem%20set%20on%20shinyapps.io.html)


# Part 2: General Principles for Your Thesis

## Main Philosophy of your problem set

```
Send the user on an interesting, data-driven journey 
into the economic contents of the article and 
present it in a logical coherent and precise way.
```
The problem set shall resemble a very well explained interactive article. It shall *not* be a tough problem set from a course that is designed to make students learn by figuring out much stuff for themselves. The user shall enter some lines of code, but she shall not forced to work too long on solving it. So don't worry that the problem set is too little work for the user. 

## Target user

Design most parts of your problem set with the following typical user in mind:

  1. The user is somebody who finds your problem set on the internet, is interested in the topic and wants to try it out.
  2. The user knows already a little bit of R, but does not necessarily know how to use packages like `dplyr`.
  3. The user is primarily interested in a logical and well explained economic analysis.
  4. Whenever the user has computed something, show the output (or parts of it) and give a short explanation or interpretation of the results after the code chunk. Don't compute something now that won't be explained immediatley and used only much later.
  5. While the user is also interested in learning some R tricks and seeing and adapting examples of well written R code, she does not like spending time searching through the internet or help files in order to find R commands or their precise syntax. She rather wants you to first  give an example, that she can adapt. She also strongly prefers short, elegant R code & tricks from existing packages. She does not like inelegant, complicated code.
  6. While the user likes solving and reading a well designed problem set, she also can quickly become bored. If solving the task becomes too complicated or she must do too much repeated work, she will just stop solving the problem set. It is ok if the user does not have to type much code. You can also use a lot of quizzes instead of asking the user to type R code.
  7. If the user has good knowledge of R and economics, she should be able to solve the problem set quite quickly by adapting the examples you provide in the task description.


## Logical and Precise Structure and Statements

A very important aspect of a good Master or Bachelor thesis is a clear structure of the problem set. As important is that you always write down clear, precise and logical coeherent arguments and explanations. 

  - If you state some fact that cannot be seen from the analysis so far, always cite the reference.  
  - If you make a statement, always tell precisely how you derive this statement from the analysis. If it is an interpretation, make clear that this is an interpretation. Don't claim that your or the authors' interpretations must be true if there are also other interpretations. Try to avoid opinions.
  - You don't have to share all interpretations of the authors of the underlying article.
  - It is really difficult to combine clear, precise and logical coherent argumentation with informal, entertaining language. While it is understandable that you want to design your problem set in an entertaining way, clearness and preciseness is much more important, and much more grade relevant, for a thesis.

## Present Data in Detail

Before diving into regressions or the theoretical model, you should describe the data in detail using summary statistics, plots and verbal descriptions. This part is often relatively short in articles, but can be longer in your problem set.

## Quality is much more important than quantity

Your problem set should really be carefully designed and well written. This takes time and space. If your problem set is already quite long and you don't have time to treat all analysis of the paper carefully, just leave out some extensions that are discussed in the paper. Of course, the core analysis should be part of the problem set. From a quality and grade perspective, it is much better to leave out some analysis than adding a poorly done analysis to your thesis.


## Citations and bibliography

You should cite related literature as in any other thesis and add a bibliography at the end of your thesis. There should be a considerable amount of references (articles and R packages and possibly econometric text books) in your thesis. For example, if you explain some econometric procedure you may cite an econometric text book or articles that provide more detailed overviews. Similar to citations in footnotes, you can briefly discuss this literature in an info block. Citation format should be the same as in a normal thesis, e.g.:

    ... see Greene (2011, chapter 7) for more details.
    
At the end of your last exercise you should add a list of all cited literature (a bibliography) using a similar format as you would use in your thesis.

Of course you can also add web links in your problem set. You must not necessarily use the common citation format for web links and may not necessarily add them to bibliography. Decide yourself, whether you think this is sensible or not for a particular link. You can look at existing problem sets of how citations are incorporated. 

## Language & Spellchecking

You can write your thesis in English or German. English has advantages since the original article and most of the R documentation is in English. Yet, if you don't feel sufficiently fluent in English it may be preferable to write the problem set in German. Poor style and articulation will downgrade the thesis.

Anyway make sure to run a spell and grammar checker on your _sol.Rmd file.

### RStudio spell checker

RStudio has a spell checker included. Just press F7 while editing your _sol.Rmd file (or go to menu Edit --> Check Spelling).

### Using a spell and grammar checker of your Office application

Microsoft Word, for example, has a substantially more powerful spell checker than the one included in RStudio. In particular, it also check your grammar to some extend. You can directly open your .Rmd file in Word and use its spell checker. It probably will mark some of your R code or your markdown annotations as wrong, but you just can manually skip those false alerts.


## Start with an overview and table of content and end with a conclusion and bibliography

Your first 'Exercise' can have the name 'Overview' and just briefly describe the structure of your problem set and give a table of content that briefly describes the exercises. Here the user should not solve anything here.

Your last 'Exercise' can have the name 'Summary' or 'Conclusion' and can contain some final thoughts and bibliography that lists all used references.

You can create these two special exercises after you have created the 'core' of your problem set.

## Causality, Endogeniety Problems and Omitted Variable Bias: Explain these issues very carefully

Most empirical articles in economics try to establish some causal effect of a particular explanatory variable on the dependent variable. Unfortunately, if we would just run a bivariate regression of the dependent on the explanatory variable, we would in most cases get an biassed estimator of the causal effect. That is because economic data seldom comes from a randomized experiment, and thus, we most likely have an *endogenous* explanatory variable that is correlated with the unobserved error term.

Most of the empirical strategy of a typical article is devoted to try to solve the endogeniety problem and get unbiassed estimated of a causal effect. Typical techniques are inclusion of control variables (also in the form of fixed-effects dummies) and often also instrumental variable regressions. Also difference-in-difference estimators or regression discontinuity designs are used to estimate causal effects in an unbiassed fashion.

If applicable to your article, you should very carefully explain these issues in your problem set and also reference to the appropriate chapters in econometric text books. Dealing with endogeniety is typically much more important than problems like heteroscedastic standard errors.

Often a good first step is to explain the omitted variable bias using a short regression model (only one explanatory variable) and a long regression model (two explanatory variables). A good example for such an explanation is given in Exercise 3.2 in the following problem set:

Github: [https://github.com/brigittepeter/RTutorWaterPollutionChina](https://github.com/brigittepeter/RTutorWaterPollutionChina)

Shinyapps.io: [https://brigittepeter.shinyapps.io/RTutorWaterPollutionChina](https://github.com/brigittepeter/RTutorWaterPollutionChina)

Take a look at it. You can also a look at some other RTutor problem sets listed at the end of this guide. Of course, you should always adapt any explanation to your specific article.

If an article wants to establish a causal effect, please **don't** write that some control variables are added because the \(R^2\) is too low. If we are interested in causal effects, control variables are typically added to solve an endogeniety problem, not to increase the \(R^2\).

(If we were not interested in causal effects, but just wanted a good model for prediction only, it might make more sense to try to find a model with high adjusted \(R^2\). But then one typically should also evaluate the model with other measures, like mean squared predication error in a control sample. For prediction only, it also often would make sense to use different models, like random forests, instead of a linear regression. Yet, most economic articles are in fact interested in causal effects.)

Moreover, **never** write that we have to add control variables to a model, because otherwise we don't get significant p-Values for the main variable of interest. Such `p-hacking` is statistic nonsense and absolutely bad scientific practise.


# Part 3: More Suggestions for your RTutor problem set


## Start quickly with an interesting data set.

Give only a brief background of the content and try to start quickly with loading an interesting data set. Let the user generate summary statistics and figures of interesting aspects. 

## Tell the economic story with the data

Typically, show first the data and then based on the data, develop step by step the story, hypothesis and results of the paper. Nevertheless, you still should give a very short summary, the length of a an abstract, at the beginning of the problem set.

## Use quizzes

You can ask the user a question about the data, regression results, or model in form of a quiz. There is  an addon that allows to include multiple choice and other quizes in a nice format in shiny based problem sets. It is not yet well documented, but the file `QuizExample_sol.Rmd` in the folder `/inst/examples` contains an example, how this quiz addon can be used. The examples, are hopefully self explanatory. Important is that you set the parameter `addons="quiz"` in your call to `create.ps`.


## Add a var.txt.file with variable descriptions

An important part of your initial work will be the generation of a variable description text file. It has the following format like in the following example (Header & 2 entries):

```
orgvar | var | descr

minority_dummy | minority | Dummy variable 1 if the account holder belongs to the minority community

ins_adj | above_insured | Dummy variable; 1 if the account holders total balances are above the deposit insurance coverage limit of 100,000 Rs.
```

The column `orgvar` is the name of the variable as given in the original data. The column `var` can be an alternative name that is easier to read. Separate words with `_`. Finally, the column `descr` provides a description of the variable, typically one or two sentences.

When calling `create.ps`, provide the file name of this file as argument `var.txt.file`. The variable description will then be shown in the data explorer of the HTML problem sets. Furthermore, the variable description will by default be shown as a tooltip on the column name when you display a data.frame in some code chunk.

You can translate the original variable names to your new variables in a code chunk of your problem set by using the function `translate.var.names` which is part of RTutor. Example:
```
  # Read original Stata data
  term = read.dta("term_deposit_data_file1.dta")
  # Automatically translate the variable names
  term = translate.var.names(term)
``` 


## Interpret significant coefficients and effect sizes

After showing regression results, try to verbally interpret some economically interesting significant coefficients. What do they mean (one unit increase of x changes y by ??? units)? Do they seem economically substantial or rather not so? How big is the uncertainty mirrored in the standard errors? You can also ask the user for the quantitative interpretation via a quiz (see below).

Also consider using the function `effectplot` in my package `regtools`. It helps to compare the effects that changes in different explanatory variables have on the dependent variable in a standardized fashion.

If coefficients are not significant, you may be more careful in interpreting them. Many researchers have the opinion that you should not interpret insignificant coefficients quantitatively.


## Use info blocks for background information and variable descriptions

When designing problem sets, you often face the following conflict. On the one hand, you may want to give detailed background information. On the other hand, you want your tasks sufficiently short, as you don't want to force the reader to read a lot before she can start analyzing the data. To resolve this conflict, you can put a lot of information into info blocks. The user can view info blocks whenever she likes. You should generally put a description of the relevant variables of the current data set in info blocks.

There is also the possibility to use footnotes that contain code chunks that the user can optionally solve. This feature, has first been used in the problem set `creditboomsgonebust` by Thomas Clausing, but is not yet well documented. Ask me if you want to use these footnotes. 


## Create short code chunks and always add explanations and discussions afterwards

Try to avoid too many commands in one code chunk, but rather create more chunks. It is totally OK if the user only has to enter one or two commands in each code chunk. Whenever the user performed some analysis, provide a short explanation or discussion afterwards that helps the user to interpret the results.


## Allow exercises to be solved independent from each other

RTutor has the option to use results from an earlier exercise in a later exercise. This requires that the user can only start the later exercise if he has finished the earlier exercise. Try to avoid this structure in your problem set. Instead allow each exercise to be solved separately. This means that typically you will load some data at the beginning of each exercise, even though you have already loaded the data before.

## Split long exercises

Try to avoid very long exercises. Better split them up in sub-exercises, e.g. Exercise 3.1 , Exercise 3.2 and so on.

## Only load the data you currently need

Don't load and prepare all data sets at once, but try to start small and only load the data set you need for the current steps of the analysis.

## Start with a descriptive or graphical analysis before you prepare the data

It is OK if at some later point you want to teach the user how to modify and prepare data for the analysis (such skills are definitely useful since much time is usually spent with data preparation). Yet, try to start the problem set with loading data and showing some description or plot. Relegate data preparation to later parts. This means you may provide the user with a data set that you have prepared already yourself. In a later exercise you can explain how you have prepared that data.

## Don't let the user repeat boring tasks

While you can ask the user some time to prepare or modify data, don't let him do all data preparation. Let him learn interesting and useful things, but don't let him do boring work.

## Write elegant R code and use the recommended packages

There are many ways to perform some analysis in R, but one goal of the problem sets is to teach rather elegant solutions. "Elegant" typically means just a few lines of code that can be easily read. Of course, it is not so easy to write elegant code when you are yourself not yet an R expert. One thing you definitely should do is to read the section *"Recommended Packages"* and use those packages for typical tasks like data manipulation, plotting or showing regression outputs in a nice format.

## include auxialliary functions in an `extra.code.file`

You may want to write some own functions that simplify some steps of the analysis and make the user code shorter. You can put them into an extra .r file whose file name you pass as argument `extra.code.file` to `create.ps`. Your functions can then be called everywhere in the problem set. 


## Make life easy for the user: give code examples

If the user shall write some code that is a bit more complicated, try to give an example in a task plot first that he can adapt. Remember that the target user does not want to figure out complicated commands on his own but wants to see quick results.

## Make life easy for the user: give part of the code

If there is a complicated command or task, you can also give part of the code to the user in the problem set and make him adapt the code. Here is an example, how you can construct that in your solution file:

```
    ```{r "2.2.1 c)"}
    #< task_notest
    # Replace the ??? in the code below and uncomment the command.
    # plot(???, ??? , ylim = c(0,6.5))
    #>
    plot(x = open$nfo_open_date, y = open$entry_load_nfo, ylim = c(0,6.5)) 
    ```
```
Of course, once the user has seen the code. You could ask him to write the full plot command next time.

## Don't let the user write unelegant, complicated code if you know a nicer way (or your supervisor tells you a more elegant way)

Sometimes you think it could be a good idea that the user first uses a complicated way to solve problem and you only later tell how she can solve it more elegantly. Typically this not such a good idea and it is better to skip the inelegant solution and immediately start with the elegant solution.


## Code lines not longer than 80 characters

In order for the code chunks being nicely displayed in the HTML version of RTutor, please
avoid lines of codes that are longer than 80 characters. You can add manual line breaks in
your R code.


# Part 4: Recommended packages and functions

This sections gives recommendations for packages and functions you should use for common tasks in your problem sets. 


## Regressions

### present regression results: stargazer

The package `stargazer` contains the function `stargazer` that allows to show regression results as nice HTML tables similar to the tables shown in scientific articles. The package `texreg` contains similar functions, but seem a bit less powerful and not compatible with as large a set of regression models. 

That function `showreg` in my package `regtools` is a wrapper to `texreg` or `stagazer` and also allows to show robust standard errors (not clustered ones) in a simple fashion (see below).


### basic regression functions

The base R functions `lm` and `glm` allow linear regressions and generalized linear models, including Tobit and probit regressions. But there are many specialized functions and packages for other sorts of regressions, e.g.

  - `lfe`: for estimating large panel data sets with fixed effects, also allows IV estimation and clustered standard errors. `lfe` is a real useful package.
  - `mlogit`: discrete choice data
  
For other models search the internet.

### Robust standard errors: lfe, sandwich, multiwayvcov

Dealing with robust standard errors in R is traditionally a bit more complicated than in Stata, but can be done. 

Often papers report 'cluster robust' standard errors. To obtain these, it is best to run your linear regression or IV regression with the function `felm` in the package `lfe`, which allows for clusters in the regression formula (see the documentation for `felm`). If you output the results with `stargazer` or `showreg` those cluster robust standard errors should then be automatically be shown.

Many other forms of robust standard errors can be computed with the package `sandwich`, but there is no direct support for clustered standard errors. The package `multiwayvcov` allows different versions of clustered standard errors. If you want to show the robust standard errors with stargazer, you have to provide the computed standard errors separately.

For simplicity, the function `showreg` contains the arguments `robust` and `robust.type` or the more general `vcov.li` that allow showing robust standard errors in an output table.


### Marginal effects for probit and logit models:

To show marginal effects for probit and logit models use the argument `coef.transform="mfx"` in `showreg`. It based on functions from the package `mfx` (not yet fully tested, though)

## Effect sizes: effectplot (in regtools)

Since explanatory variables are usually measured in different units, it is often not easy to compare the sizes of the effects that 'typical' changes of different explanatory variables have on the dependent variable in a regression model. The function `effectplot` in my package `regtools` shall help for such comparison. The key idea is to compare the effects the explanatory variables change from e.g. their 10% quantile to their 90% quantile. For non-linear specifications also the package `effects` is quite helpful, to see how effects change over the range of values of an explanatory variable.

## Data preparation: dplyr, tidyr and dplyrExtras

The package `dplyr` and `tidyr` provide a very well thought through framework for many common data manipulation tasks and the functions run fast also for big data sets. Try to use them. Unfortunately, `dplyr` is still very young and I was missing some functionality. Therefore I wrote the package `dplyrExtras` provides that can be installed from Github:
```s
library(devtools);
install_github(repo="dplyrExtras", username="skranz")
```

### Summarising and aggregating data: dplyr (group_by and summarise)

For summarizing data, the `summarise` function in `dplyr` is very useful. Combine it with the `group_by` function to perform summaries by groups. Also the `summarise_each` function, as well as the `xsummarise_each` function in `dplyrExtras`, can be helpful. 


## Graphics: ggplot2 and more

A very nice and powerful graphics package is `gpplot2`. Even though the syntax may look a bit complicated at the beginning, I recommend to use it for most of your figures.  

The ggplot2 package is nicely complemented by the `ggthemes` package that contains several additional themes for the appearance of your plots. I particularly like `theme_wsj()`, which renders your graphics in a 'Wall Street Journal' theme. There is also a Stata theme: `theme_stata()`, which may make your graphs look more similar to those in the original article.

For simple plots you may also sometimes use the standard R functions like `plot` or `hist`. For interactive plots take a look at the packages `googleVis`. In particular the motion plots in `googleVis` can be quite nice. To use it, set in the chunk header the option `results="asis"` to make the output be displayed as HTML. I have not yet figured out how the promising `ggvis` package can be best integrated with RTutor.
